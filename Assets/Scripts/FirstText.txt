suppressed by the officers of the court.  (As that is rather a

into this they slipped the guinea-pig, head first, and then sat
upon it.)

read in the newspapers, at the end of trials, "There was some
attempts at applause, which was immediately suppressed by the
officers of the court," and I never understood what it meant
till now.'
